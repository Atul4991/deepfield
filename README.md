# DeepField
Salesforce DeepField identifies layouts, formulas, classes, etc where a field is used.

I thought of developing it after coming across an idea on the Salesforce Ideas portal where a lot of people asked for it - https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000Br56AAC

It is still a work-in-progress.
